## Source Code ##

The source code hosted at this Google Code project serves simply as a read-only mirror of the main development branch at Texas A&M. It will be updated periodically with new releases of the library.

### Dependencies ###

The library depends on [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org/), version 1.6 or higher.

The build system has the option of using the [Yahoo UI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/) for minification. JsDoc is used for documentation generation.

### Documentation ###

When documenting the source code, please follow the [documentation conventions](DeveloperDocumentation.md).

### Coding Standards ###

We follow Douglas Crockford's popular [JavaScript coding conventions](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html).
